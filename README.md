##1 Goal 
Given a binary image, write a code in C++ that uses Depth First Search algorithm to ﬁnd all the connected components in the image. For each connected component ﬁnd: 
* the centroid 
* the 7 invariant moments 
* the perimeter and the surface area 

Create a ﬁle in which each record containsdata collected from each image(number of connected components, data collected in (a), (b) and (c))
##2 The dataset 
The data set used consists of 20 folders each containing 3 images(60 images in total).
